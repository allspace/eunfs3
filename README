Enhancements include:
- Better compatibility with NFS clients, e.g. ESXi Server.
- Pseudo-implementation of READDIRPLUS, make it work with client which 
  does not really concern "name_attributes" and "name_handle".
- Disable exports list procedure, so malicious/security audit program 
  will not be able to detect exports of your NFS server.

UNFS3 (User-Space NFSv3 Server)
(C) 2003-2009, Pascal Schmidt <unfs3-server@ewetel.net>


INTRODUCTION
============

UNFS3 is a user-space implementation of the NFSv3 server
specification.

UNFS3 supports all NFSv3 procedures with the exception of the
READDIRPLUS procedure. It tries to provide as much information
to NFS clients as possible, within the limits possible from
user-space.

See the unfsd(8) manpage for restrictions imposed on NFS
operations (section RESTRICTIONS) and for possible races
with local file system activity (section BUGS).

It is not possible to export to netgroups or wildcard hostnames
via /etc/exports, all other addressing methods should work. The
following options are recognized in the exports file: ro, rw,
root_squash, all_squash, no_root_squash, no_all_squash. If
other options are present, they are ignored.

UNFS3 can be used to (re-)export part of an AFS network filesystem. 
Because AFS does not simulate inodes particularly well, configuring the 
source with --enable-afs is recommended in this scenario.

Cluster extensions compatible to the older ClusterNFS project
are supported when the source is configured with --enable-cluster.


SUPPORTED SYSTEMS
=================

unfs3 is developed and tested on Linux, but should also compile
and run on other Unix systems. In the past, versions of unfs3
have been successfully tested on NetBSD, FreeBSD, Solaris, AIX,
Irix, and Mac OS X. There is also some support for running on
Windows, see doc/README.win for details.

Releases are tested by trying to compile them on Linux using both
GNU make and FreeBSD make. The basic tests of the Connectathon
NFS testsuite are then used to very basic functionality of the
server.

If unfs3 doesn't build or work on a Unix system, a problem
report is appreciated.


INSTALLATION
============

You will need gcc, lex (flex), and yacc (bison) to compile UNFS3.

	./configure
	make
	make install

Please read the manpage for information about command-line
options.

	man 8 unfsd

If you decide to modify the code yourself, you can run

	make dep
	
to append dependency information to the Makefile, so that make
knows which files depend on each other and recompiles all the
necessary files on changes.
